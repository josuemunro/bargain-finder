PHP based web application to be deployed to the AWS cloud using AWS CodeDeploy.

When finished, it should display TradeMe listings via their API.
The listings displayed will be listings that end at off-peak times so you can get good deals without competition.

Currently only using the TradeMe Sandbox API for testing.
Application is in a very barebones state of working.
