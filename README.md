Ooops!! If you're marking this please use commit c280c6f.
I've started trying to make this better for my own use outside of COSC349

PHP based web application to be deployed to the AWS cloud using AWS CodeDeploy.

When finished, it should display TradeMe listings via their API.
The listings displayed will be listings that end at off-peak times so you can get good deals without competition.

Currently only using the TradeMe Sandbox API for testing.
Application is in a very barebones state of working.
